# 🌌 uGalaxy – STM32 Game 🎮

A simple 'Space Shooter' game written for an **STM32L4** microcontroller 🖥️ with a **128×128 OLED** display 🖼️ based on the **SSD1327** controller.  
The idea for the game came while I was still at university in 2014 🎓, at a time when the first version was developed for a 128×64 OLED screen and SSD1306 controller.

## 🌟 Why this project stands out 🚀

uGalaxy is not just another microcontroller demo – it’s a fully playable, feature-rich arcade shooter 🎯 built from the ground up for embedded hardware 🔧.  
It shows how much can be achieved on a **low-power STM32** ⚡ with limited RAM and Flash, when paired with efficient C code and smart game logic 🧠.

### ✨ Key Highlights
- 🛠️ **Runs on bare-metal STM32** with STM32 HAL (no OS required)  
- ⚡ **Optimized for performance and memory** – smooth gameplay on an 80 MHz Cortex-M4 with only 64 KB RAM  
- 🎮 **Full-featured game loop** including:
  - 🔟 10 progressively challenging levels
  - 👾 Boss battles with unique movement and attack patterns
  - 🌠 Background animation with dynamic starfield
  - 🎁 Power-ups: extra lives ❤️ & guided missiles 🎯  
- 🖥️ **SSD1327 OLED driver integration** – custom graphics routines for grayscale rendering  
- 📂 **Modular code structure** with separate layers for:
  - 🧩 Game logic
  - 🎨 Graphics rendering
  - 🎛️ Hardware abstraction (input, display, ADC joystick)

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 💻 **Microcontroller:** STM32L432KC (Cortex-M4, 80 MHz, 256 KB Flash, 64 KB RAM)
- 🖼️ **Display:** Waveshare 128×128 OLED, SSD1327 controller
- 📜 **Language:** C (C99 standard)
- 🛠️ **Framework:** STM32CubeIDE + STM32 HAL
- 🎨 **Graphics Library:** Custom SSD1327 GFX layer with bitmap, shape, and text drawing functions
- 🔌 **Peripherals:**
  - 🔄 SPI for display communication
  - 🎚️ ADC for analog joystick input
  - ⏺️ GPIO for button controls

### 📈 What this project demonstrates
- 🧠 Advanced embedded programming techniques  
- 🎨 Efficient 2D rendering on resource-constrained devices  
- 🎮 Game development principles applied to microcontroller platforms  
- 📜 Clear, maintainable C codebase suitable for educational and hobby projects
